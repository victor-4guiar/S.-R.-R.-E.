Hello! I am <strong>Victor Aguiar</strong>, a junior programmer who is making this "Sonic Fangame", in reality it is just a mini-project for training.

For now there's not much to say about it, but there'll be when there's a new update. But anyway, thanks for reading this and I hope you like the next update!
